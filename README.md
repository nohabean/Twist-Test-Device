# Twist Test Device

A device created to test beverage packaging. Mimics a consumer holding the pack of cans and twisting 90 degrees forward and then 90 degrees backward to the start position. Coded using C++ in the Arduino IDE.

The device consists of a servo motor and a button hooked up to an Arduino board. Additional 3D components were created and printed to contain the components and mount them onto a frame. Custom handles to hold the packages being tested were also created to be mounted to the device. An LCD screen was also added to print the total cycle count to easily track how many cycles a package can last before failure.

To run, code will need to be run in Arduino while hooked up to the board. From here, the button can be used to stop and start the device. The count will reset when the button is pressed to start the device again.
